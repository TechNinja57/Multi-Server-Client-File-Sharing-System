# Multi-Server-Client-File-Sharing-System
## Main Working
- The system allows users to share files among various systems.
- Those systems need to be on the same network.
- Client.py file will run on the receiver end.
- Server.py file will run on the sender end.
- If the user wants to send the original file but wants to divide the workload, then user can run two instance of Server.py file. Where the ipv4-address will be the same of sender machine but ports number will be different for those two instances of Server.py file.
- The main requirement is that client should have first hand knowledge of ipv4-address of the machines where the Server.py files are running.
